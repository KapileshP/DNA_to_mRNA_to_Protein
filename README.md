# DNA to mRNA to Protein

# About the Program
DNA to mRNA to Protein is a program created by Kapilesh Pennichetty to assist in converting a DNA sequence to an mRNA sequence and amino acids (protein) through the processes of transcription and translation. This program takes user input (DNA sequence) via the Python shell, performs transcription and translation, and returns the corresponding amino acid and mRNA codon as output.

# Requirements
Python 3.x is required to run this program.

# Inspiration Behind the Program
One day, Kapilesh's biology teacher gave him and his class a huge DNA sequence to transcribe and translate for a series of assignments (including a test) over a period of multiple weeks. Kapilesh successfully transcribed and translated the first protein from the DNA sequence manually, but by the time he was done, he realized that there was a much more efficient way to transcribe and translate DNA sequences which not only reduced the time needed to finish the task but also significantly reduced the chance of making an error- writing a program to perform the task for him. With his teacher's permission, Kapilesh wrote the script, and even though it had taken him about 1 hour, it was a good investment of time, as there were 6 protein sequences on the DNA sequence, and given that each sequence took roughly 20-30 minutes to complete, he would be saving about 40-90 minutes in total, excluding the first protein. With this program, Kapilesh got a 100% on each of the assignments about this huge DNA sequence, and when the time came around to take the test, using this program, he not only got a 100%, but he also finished the test within 6 minutes, or a tenth of the time allotted.
